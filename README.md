# Computer-Graphics
1 First Assignment is drawing line without using OpenGL function. Draw line by pure integer Bresenham's algorithm, and rendering triangle, implement antialiasing lines.

2 Second Assignment is Modeling a 3D cartoon ant, users could rotate, translate, the moving part like legs, arms, fingers of the creature via keyboard, and the eyes of the creature automatically follow the mouse position.

3 Third Assignment is Simulating a 3D vivarium of 3 kinds of fishes, one predator and two prey. Fishes have different reaction to each other, for instance flocking, predation, escape. User could add food for fishes via mouse, and could see this vivarium through stereo viewing.

4 Forth Assignment is Implement Flat, Gouraud, Phong shading, and realize infinite light, ambient light, spot light and attenuation without using OpenGL function. And apply these on different objects, ellipsoid, sphere, super-ellipsoid, which are drawn by triangle meshes. Users could drag and rotate objects to observe the effect of light

5 The maze is wrote long a ago.....
